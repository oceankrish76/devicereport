1. Statement to create database and tables.
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS devicereport;

CREATE TABLE device (
	ID INT NOT NULL,
	name VARCHAR(100),
	PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);

CREATE TABLE report (
    ID INT NOT NULL,
    Device_ID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (Device_ID)
        REFERENCES device(ID)
        ON DELETE cascade,
	Location VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
	DateCreated TIMESTAMP NOT null
        DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
	PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);

Primary Key is not asked to add so it's not included here.

2. Insert sample data into table.
INSERT INTO report (ID, Device_ID, Location) VALUES (1, 1, 'Finland');

3. Select data from both tables by joining with foreign key.
SELECT * FROM device LEFT JOIN report ON device.ID = report.Device_ID
