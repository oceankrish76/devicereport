Cross Origin Resource Sharing.

By default browsers prevent AJAX request from onother origin
 HTTP requests that are initiated from scripts running in the browser for the security purpose.
To access the released apis from different domains and use in our own domain,
we need to enable the cors policy.


In this context, "other origins" means the URL being accessed differs from the location that the JavaScript is running from, by having:

a different scheme (HTTP or HTTPS)
a different domain
a different port

Whenever the REST API's resources receive non-simple cross-origin HTTP requests,
we need to enable CORS support.

The CORS standard is needed because it allows servers to specify not only who can access the assets,
 but also how they can be accessed.

Enable:
Add config.EnableCORS in WebAPIConfig.
Add [EnableCORS] attribute to the Controller class
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * for all

https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors
This CORS is a node.js package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to
enable CORS with various options.
